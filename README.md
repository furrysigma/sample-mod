# Sample Mod

> :warning: This does NOT work on the official page! Mods will only work on our archive patcher.

### How do I use this?

On the **archived** version of thisisnotawebsitedotcom, you can use the code "mods" to access the mod list.</br>
From there, just enter in "furrysigma/sample-mod" and it will be loaded.

After loading it, the code provided is "skib". It should respond with "dop dop".

### How do I make my own mod?

Fork this repository, name it how you'd like.
In the `mod.json` file, you can define as many codes as you'd like and attach them to files *within the repository*.

> :exclamation: Mods with overlapping codes will not be prioritized, and the original code will be displayed instead.<br>
> Please also ensure that you only use the following file types (as other files will not work properly).

- .html
- .mp4
- .mp3
- .png

### Additional notes

Please ensure any files, such as images, are absolutely defined.
